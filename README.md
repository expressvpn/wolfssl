# WolfSSL (Rust)

This repository attempts to build safe and idiomatic abstractions for the
[WolfSSL Embedded SSL/TLS Library (C)][wolfssl-home]. It does so by building on
top of autogenerated bindings created by [`wolfssl-sys`][wolfssl-sys].

# Building and Running

Currently, the usual commands from `cargo` works perfectly fine. Common commands
include the following:

```
cargo build
```

```
cargo test
```

```
cargo clippy
```
